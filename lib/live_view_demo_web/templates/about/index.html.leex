    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      ElixirRegex.com was initially created for the Phoenix Phrenzy
      contest to showcase Phoenix LiveView. It was something that I
      had wanted to make for a while anyway, so this seemed like a
      perfect time with the perfect technology to create it.
      Hopefully you find it useful! I know I'll be using it regularly.
