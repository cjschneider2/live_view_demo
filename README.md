# Elixir Regex

This is my entry in [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com), showing off what [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) can do.

Elixir Regex is a regular expression checker for Elixir. Simply put in your text and the expression you'd like to use as the regular expression, enable some optional modifiers, and see the results in real time. This application may not be very flashy, but it *is* very useful.

I've wanted to make this tool for a while now and Phoenix Phrenzy seemed like the best time to make it!

# Phrenzy Instructions

Fork this repo and start build an application! See [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com) for details.

Note: for development, you'll need Elixir, Erlang and Node.js. If you use the [asdf version manager](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) and install the [relevant plugins](https://asdf-vm.com/#/plugins-all?id=plugin-list), you can install the versions specified in `.tool-versions` with `asdf install`.


## Deployment

How you deploy your app is up to you. A couple of the easiest options are:

- Heroku ([instructions](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/heroku.html))
- [Gigalixir](https://gigalixir.com/) (doesn't limit number of connections)

## The Usual README Content

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
